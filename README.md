# My Notes and Code Snippets of React JS


### Steps to create a basic react app project

> Make sure you have node and npm already installed on your system.

1. Create a folder on any location on your system. Open that folder with code editor (for eg. VS Code).
2. Go to terminal of VS Code.
3. In the terminal type `npx create-react-app projectname`. Here the "projectname" is userdefined name so you can give any name instead of it.
4. It will take some time to create the react app, so wait patiently. Once it is done you will be able to see the folder named as "projectname" in the folder you were in.
5. Type `cd projectname` in the terminal in order to move to the default react app created. Once you are inside that projectname folder in terminal, you can start coding.
6. In order to run react app, type `npm start` in the terminal. Make sure you are in the projectname folder only.
7. Once you type `npm start`, a default react webpage will run on the browser. From here you can go back to VS Code and start building and coding.
